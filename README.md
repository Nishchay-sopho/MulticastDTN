There are two implementations of multicast here:
1. The static multicast: Here, the receivers are predefined in the settings file. This makes the multicast static and routing is mostly epidemic.
2. Dynamic multicast: This is an underdevelopment method of multicast where a dynamic notion of group is maintained in the network.
